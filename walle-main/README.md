# Autonomous Robot with Robotic Arm and Electromagnet

This project is an autonomous robot that is capable of driving and picking up objects with its robotic arm and electromagnet.

## Features
Autonomous driving: The robot is capable of driving itself and avoiding obstacles using sensors and algorithms.
Robotic arm: The robot has a 2-axis robotic arm that can be controlled remotely and has a range of motion that allows it to pick up objects from various angles.
Electromagnet: The robot's electromagnet can be used to pick up ferromagnetic objects, such as metal parts.
Control interface: The robot can be controlled remotely using a computer through a user-friendly interface.
